## Workflow Examples

### Complete Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Set up workspace (first time only)
/work:linear-setup

# 2. Create issue for new feature
/work:creatework "Add user authentication with JWT"

# 3. Execute the work
/work:performwork AUTH-123

# 4. Validate implementation
/work:validate

# 5. Check system health
/work:diagnostic
```

### Bug Fix Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create bug issue
/work:creatework "Fix memory leak in event processor"

# 2. Perform the fix with type safety
/work:performwork BUG-456

# 3. Validate the fix
/work:validate
```

### System Health Check

```bash
# Quick diagnostic
/work:diagnostic quick

# Full system check
/work:diagnostic full
```

## Enterprise Features

### Type Safety Verification

The plugin enforces mandatory type checking before marking work as complete:

- **Auto-refactor simple errors**: Automatically fixes common TypeScript errors
- **Block completion on errors**: Cannot mark work Done if type errors exist
- **Truth enforcement**: Ensures documentation reflects actual implementation
- **Max refactor rounds**: Prevents infinite loops with configurable limits

### Pattern Learning

The system learns from historical data:

- Issue creation patterns
- Validation patterns
- Common requirements by type
- Suggested labels
- Similar issue detection

### Performance Optimization

Built-in optimizations for enterprise scale:

- Smart parallelization
- Validation caching
- Batch API operations
- Checkpoint and recovery
- Performance monitoring

### Error Recovery

Comprehensive error handling:

- Automatic retry with backoff
- Checkpoint system for long operations
- Error recovery strategies
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed error reporting

## Configuration

### Execution Modes

- **Quick**: Minimal discovery, fast execution
- **Standard**: Balanced approach (default)
- **Comprehensive**: Maximum quality and discovery

### Quality Controls

```typescript
{
  requirementReReadInterval: 30,     // Re-read requirements every 30 min
  scopeCreepTolerance: 0,            // Zero tolerance for scope creep
  todoWriteMapping: '1:1',           // One todo per requirement
  mandatoryTypeCheck: true,          // Must pass type check
  blockCompletionOnErrors: true      // Cannot complete with errors
}
```

## Integration with Linear

The plugin integrates seamlessly with Linear:

- **Issue Creation**: Smart deduplication and enhancement
- **Issue Execution**: Requirement tracking and validation
- **Workspace Setup**: Automated configuration
- **Status Updates**: Automatic progress tracking
- **Quality Gates**: Type safety before completion

## Best Practices

### Issue Creation

1. Provide clear, specific descriptions
2. Include relevant context and constraints
3. Let the system suggest labels based on patterns
4. Review deduplication suggestions

### Issue Execution

1. Always read requirements thoroughly
2. Enable type safety verification
3. Use comprehensive mode for complex tasks
4. Run diagnostics if issues occur

### Validation

1. Validate after significant changes
2. Use caching for faster repeated validations
3. Review all validation layers
4. Fix issues before marking complete

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Type errors blocking completion**:
- Review TypeScript errors
- Use auto-refactor for simple errors
- Fix complex errors manually
- Re-run validation

**Deduplication false positives**:
- Provide more specific descriptions
- Review suggested similar issues
- Override if necessary

**Performance issues**:
- Run diagnostics: `/work:diagnostic`
- Check system health
- Clear caches if needed
- Adjust parallelization mode
